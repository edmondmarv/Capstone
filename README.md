### About U.S. Census Data
  The U.S. Census Bureau has been headquartered in Suitland, Md. since 1942, and currently
employs about 4,285 staff members. The Census Bureau is part of the U.S. Department
of Commerce and is overseen by the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) within
the Department of Commerce. The Economics and Statistics Administration provides highquality
economic analysis and fosters the missions of the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau
of Economic Analysis.


### Project Purpose
  Wanting to practice my newly acquired machine learning skills, I searched for a project which
would be interesting. Census data is always available with an abundance of information but,
determining which specific variables to use to predict annual income was a fun challenge. Even
though the project was simple, I gives me further insight into the power of machine learning.
